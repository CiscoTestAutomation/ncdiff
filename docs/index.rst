yang.ncdiff
===========

A package containing a set of classes that calculate diff of two configs,
combine two configs or two diffs, and predict config when a diff is applied to
a config. A config is the rpc-reply payload of a get-config message, and a diff
can be considered as the payload of an edit-config message.
